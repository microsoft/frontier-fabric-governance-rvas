# Challenge 08 — Deployment pipelines & cross-environment promotion

> **Outcome:** items promote dev → stg → prd through **Fabric deployment
> pipelines**, gated by PR labels and the same `production` environment approval
> as Challenge 01.

## Why this challenge exists

Use Fabric deployment pipelines to promote items instead of moving them manually
between workspaces in the portal. Reuse the PR review, OIDC authentication, and
environment gate from Challenge 01 when "going to prod".

## Learning objectives

1. Model Fabric deployment pipelines as code.
2. Trigger a stage promotion (`dev → stg`, `stg → prd`) from a PR label.
3. Reuse the `production` GitHub environment as the manual gate for prod
   promotions.
4. Implement a rollback flow (`revert/prd`) that re-applies the previous
   successful state.

## Prerequisites

- Challenges 00–02 complete.
- For each pipeline you intend to model, you have a dev / stg / prd workspace
  trio under repo management.

## Tasks

### Task 1 — Pipeline manifest

Add `schemas/pipeline.schema.json` and example:

```yaml
# pipelines/finance-revenue.yaml
name: finance-revenue
description: "Promotion pipeline for the Finance Revenue medallion stack."
stages:
  - name: dev
    workspace: dev-fin-gold
  - name: stg
    workspace: stg-fin-gold
  - name: prd
    workspace: prd-fin-gold
promotionRules:
  - from: dev
    to: stg
    label: promote/stg
    requiresReviewers: ["@org/fabric-platform"]
  - from: stg
    to: prd
    label: promote/prd
    requiresReviewers: ["@org/fabric-governance", "@org/security"]
    environment: production
itemsToPromote:
  - kind: Lakehouse
    namePattern: "lh_gold_*"
  - kind: SemanticModel
    namePattern: "sm_gold_*"
  - kind: Report
    namePattern: "rpt_gold_*"
```

### Task 2 — Validate pipeline manifests

Extend `scripts/validate.py`:

- Every `stages[*].workspace` references a workspace manifest.
- Stages are in order `dev` → `stg` → `prd`.
- `prd` rule must require `environment: production`.
- `itemsToPromote[*].namePattern` is a valid regex.

### Task 3 — `promote.yml` workflow

Add `.github/workflows/promote.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled]
jobs:
  promote:
    if: startsWith(github.event.label.name, 'promote/')
    runs-on: [self-hosted, fabric-gov]
    environment: ${{ contains(github.event.label.name, 'prd') && 'production' || '' }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: azure/login@v2
        with:
          client-id: ${{ vars.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
          tenant-id: ${{ vars.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
      - run: python scripts/promote.py --label "${{ github.event.label.name }}" \
                                      --pr ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
```

### Task 4 — Implement `scripts/promote.py`

In `promote.py`:

1. Resolve the pipeline manifest whose items match the PR diff (or accept an
   explicit `--pipeline` argument set by a PR comment).
2. Look up the Fabric deployment pipeline ID by name (create if absent).
3. Bind stages to workspace IDs via the deployment pipelines API.
4. Compute the item set to promote (intersect `itemsToPromote[*].namePattern`
   with items present in the *source* stage workspace).
5. Call **Deploy stage** API for `from → to`.
6. Poll the long-running operation. On success, post a summary on the PR.
   On failure, leave the PR open.

### Task 5 — Rollback

`revert/prd` label triggers `scripts/promote.py --revert prd`:

1. Find the previous successful deployment for the pipeline.
2. Re-deploy that snapshot to prd (via the deployment pipelines API).
3. Open a follow-up issue requiring a post-mortem PR.

### Task 6 — Verify via Fabric Core MCP

```
Show items in workspace prd-fin-gold. Highlight which were updated in the last hour.
List the deployment pipelines I have access to. Which stage is each workspace in?
```

## Success criteria

- [ ] Labelling a PR with `promote/stg` promotes items from `dev` → `stg`.
- [ ] Labelling a PR with `promote/prd` *also* triggers the `production`
      environment gate before the items move.
- [ ] `revert/prd` puts prd back to the prior successful snapshot.

## Stretch goals

- **Schema-drift checks.** Before promoting Gold semantic models, run a schema
  diff between source and target — block on breaking changes.
- **Selective promotion.** Allow PR comments like `/promote only sm_gold_revenue`
  to override `itemsToPromote`.
- **Canary releases.** Use deployment rules / source-control branching to ship a
  subset of users a new gold report first; gate full rollout on a metric.

## MCP tips

- The Core MCP `get_operation_state` and `get_operation_result` tools poll
  long-running operations. Use the same API from `promote.py`.

## Skills tips

- Use `sqldw-operations-cli` and `spark-operations-cli` to check warehouse runtime
  stats and Spark job health before promotion as a "stage gate" check.
