# Challenge 05 — Medallion architecture bootstrap

> **Outcome:** a single PR scaffolds a fully governed Bronze / Silver / Gold
> lakehouse set with the right sensitivity labels, endorsement, and reference
> notebooks — using the **`e2e-medallion-architecture`** Skill end-to-end.

## Why this challenge exists

Bootstrap medallion architecture and governance in one atomic PR. Set labels and
endorsement during provisioning rather than "later", and keep Gold workspaces
from inheriting dev's sensitivity floor.

## Learning objectives

1. Drive a complex multi-item scaffold from a single high-level manifest.
2. Encode each tier's sensitivity, endorsement, owners group, and allowed users.
3. Use the `e2e-medallion-architecture` Skill to scaffold the artifacts.
4. Validate and provision the Skill's output through your workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Challenges 00–02 complete (item manifests already work).
- Capacity at F4+ recommended.
- Skill installed: `e2e-medallion-architecture` (plus `spark-authoring-cli`,
  `sqldw-authoring-cli`, `powerbi-authoring-cli` for sub-tasks the medallion
  skill orchestrates).

## Tasks

### Task 1 — Design the medallion manifest

Add `schemas/medallion.schema.json` and example
`challenges/05-medallion-bootstrap/starter/medallion/finance-revenue.yaml`:

```yaml
name: finance-revenue
description: "End-to-end medallion stack for Finance Revenue Reporting."
businessUnit: Finance
domain: Finance
sourceSystem:
  kind: AzureSql
  connectionRef: kv-secret://finance-sql-prd
tiers:
  bronze:
    workspace: dev-fin-bronze
    lakehouse: lh_bronze_revenue
    sensitivityLabel: General
    endorsement: null
    ownersGroup: sg-fin-engineers
  silver:
    workspace: dev-fin-silver
    lakehouse: lh_silver_revenue
    sensitivityLabel: General
    endorsement: Promoted
    ownersGroup: sg-fin-engineers
  gold:
    workspace: prd-fin-gold
    lakehouse: lh_gold_revenue
    semanticModel: sm_gold_revenue
    sensitivityLabel: Confidential
    endorsement: Certified
    ownersGroup: sg-fin-admins
schedule:
  bronzeToSilver: "0 2 * * *"
  silverToGold: "0 4 * * *"
```

### Task 2 — Policy: per-tier defaults

Add a `medallion:` block to `rules/policy.yaml`:

- Gold tier must have `sensitivityLabel ≥ Confidential`.
- Gold tier must have `endorsement = Certified`.
- Gold tier `workspace` must match `^prd-`.
- Bronze and Silver workspaces must reference a non-prod capacity.
- The `ownersGroup` for gold must include at least one Security-cleared admin.

### Task 3 — Validator extension

`scripts/validate_medallion.py` (or extend `validate.py`):

1. For each medallion manifest, validate against the schema + medallion policy.
2. Validate that the referenced workspaces exist as manifests in `workspaces/`
   (or auto-create them in `starter/` based on the medallion manifest).
3. Validate that owners groups exist in Entra (live check).

### Task 4 — Provisioner: call the Skill

Call the Skill from a workflow with deterministic inputs to create the artifacts.

In `.github/workflows/medallion.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Bootstrap medallion via Skill
  run: |
    copilot skill run e2e-medallion-architecture \
      --manifest ${{ matrix.manifest }} \
      --output-dir .skill-output/
- name: Capture artifacts into manifests
  run: python scripts/capture_medallion_output.py \
       --input .skill-output/ \
       --into items/
- name: Provision items
  run: python scripts/provision.py --items .skill-output/items.txt
```

The Skill scaffolds notebooks, lakehouse schemas, and a semantic model. Your
`capture_medallion_output.py` converts the Skill's output into item
manifests under `items/`, so the next drift run can reconcile them.

### Task 5 — Apply endorsement and labels

After provisioning, set:

- Endorsement (`Promoted` or `Certified`) via the Power BI admin API on
  semantic models / reports in the Gold workspace.
- Sensitivity labels on the lakehouses (Challenge 03 wiring already does this).

### Task 6 — Smoke test

Open a PR that adds your medallion manifest. After merge and environment approval,
confirm:

1. Bronze, Silver, and Gold workspaces exist.
2. Bronze/Silver/Gold lakehouses exist with the per-tier label.
3. Gold semantic model exists, certified.
4. Drift detector reports zero drift.

Ask the Fabric Core MCP:

```
Search the catalog for items matching "revenue". Group by workspace.
What's the sensitivity label and endorsement of the "sm_gold_revenue" semantic model?
```

## Success criteria

- [ ] One medallion manifest produces ≥ 3 workspaces, ≥ 3 lakehouses, and ≥ 1
      semantic model, all with correct labels and endorsement.
- [ ] Removing the `endorsement: Certified` line on Gold fails validation.
- [ ] The Skill output is captured into `items/` so drift detection can check it.

## Stretch goals

- **Templatized variants.** Parameterize the medallion manifest to support
  finance vs. marketing source schemas with one shared template.
- **Notebook tests.** Each tier's transformation notebook gets a companion test
  notebook the validate workflow runs in dry-run mode.
- **Cost guardrails.** Tag every medallion item with `cost-stream: finance-revenue`;
  build a Power BI report in Challenge 07 that breaks down spend per medallion.

## MCP tips

- Use the **local MCP** `docs_best-practices` tool with topic `medallion` before
  designing your manifest to read the official guidance the Skill follows.

## Skills tips

- The `e2e-medallion-architecture` skill is composable. If you only need
  Bronze → Silver, call it with just those tiers and skip Gold; your validator
  must allow that shape.
