# Challenge 07 — Audit & observability

> **Outcome:** every governance event (PRs, workflow runs, Fabric activity, drift
> findings) lands in an Eventhouse, surfaces in a Power BI dashboard, and trips
> Activator alerts when anomalies appear.

## Why this challenge exists

Track governance from PR through provisioning, audit, dashboards, alerts, and the
next PR. Use four authoring skills from "Skills for Fabric" to build the audit
store, ingestion, dashboard, and alerts.

## Learning objectives

1. Use `eventhouse-authoring-cli` to create a KQL database for governance audit.
2. Use `eventstream-authoring-cli` to ingest GitHub webhook events and Fabric
   activity events into that KQL database in near real-time.
3. Use `powerbi-authoring-cli` to publish a "Governance Health" dashboard.
4. Use `activator-authoring-cli` to fire alerts when metrics breach thresholds.
5. Use `eventhouse-consumption-cli` to answer governance questions ad-hoc from chat.

## Prerequisites

- Challenges 00–02 complete (you need at least one provisioned workspace and the
  items machinery).
- Capacity F4+ recommended (Eventhouse + Power BI consume compute).
- Skills installed: `eventhouse-authoring-cli`, `eventhouse-consumption-cli`,
  `eventstream-authoring-cli`, `powerbi-authoring-cli`, `activator-authoring-cli`.

## Tasks

### Task 1 — Provision the audit workspace via PR

Add a workspace manifest `workspaces/dev-plt-gov-audit.yaml` with sensitivity
`Confidential` and a `gov-audit` cost-center tag. Merge it (Challenge 01 flow).

### Task 2 — Create the Eventhouse and KQL database

From chat:

```
@eventhouse-authoring-cli In workspace "dev-plt-gov-audit", create an Eventhouse
"eh_gov_audit" with KQL database "gov_audit" and tables:
  - pr_events(received_at:datetime, pr_id:long, action:string, repo:string,
              author:string, labels:dynamic, payload:dynamic)
  - workflow_runs(received_at:datetime, run_id:long, name:string, status:string,
                  conclusion:string, repo:string, head_sha:string, payload:dynamic)
  - fabric_activity(received_at:datetime, activity:string, user:string,
                    workspaceId:string, itemId:string, payload:dynamic)
Apply 90-day retention on all tables.
```

Commit the Skill's output (KQL `.kql` files + Eventhouse definition) into
`items/dev-plt-gov-audit/`.

### Task 3 — Ingest GitHub webhook events

Use **Eventstream**:

```
@eventstream-authoring-cli In workspace "dev-plt-gov-audit", create an Eventstream
"es_gh_audit" with:
  - Source: Custom App (HTTP) — used by a GitHub webhook
  - Destinations: Eventhouse "eh_gov_audit", tables "pr_events" and "workflow_runs"
```

Configure a **GitHub webhook** on the repo pointing at the Eventstream's HTTP
ingestion URL. Pick events: `pull_request`, `workflow_run`, `pull_request_review`.

### Task 4 — Ingest Fabric activity events

Two options; pick one:

**Option A (admin API export).** A scheduled workflow
`.github/workflows/audit-export.yml` calls
`GET /admin/activityevents` once per hour and posts events to the Eventstream HTTP
source.

**Option B (Purview audit pipe).** Configure Purview Audit → Activity Explorer
→ Eventstream connector (preview, where available).

Confirm events arrive in `fabric_activity`.

### Task 5 — Build the governance dashboard

From chat:

```
@powerbi-authoring-cli In workspace "dev-plt-gov-audit", create a Power BI report
"Governance Health" connected to KQL database "gov_audit" with pages:
  - Workspaces: count by domain, label coverage %
  - PR throughput: median time from PR open to merge, by week
  - Provision outcomes: success / failure counts by week
  - Drift: open drift issues by category
  - Access: number of User Admin bindings on prd workspaces (target = 0)
```

Commit the report definition into `items/dev-plt-gov-audit/`.

### Task 6 — Activator alerts

From chat:

```
@activator-authoring-cli In workspace "dev-plt-gov-audit", create reflexes that fire when:
  - More than 5 unmanaged workspaces are detected in a 24h window.
  - Any User Admin appears on a prd-* workspace.
  - A provision run fails 3+ times in a row.
  - A drift issue stays open for more than 7 days.
```

Wire reflex outputs to a Teams / email channel.

### Task 7 — Answer questions from chat

Use `eventhouse-consumption-cli` to validate:

```
@eventhouse-consumption-cli In gov_audit, how many PRs labelled "break-glass"
were merged in the last 30 days, and who reviewed them?
```

```
@eventhouse-consumption-cli In gov_audit, show median minutes from PR open to
provision success per repo, weekly, last 8 weeks.
```

## Success criteria

- [ ] PR open / merge events appear in `pr_events` within 60 seconds.
- [ ] Workflow run completions appear in `workflow_runs` within 60 seconds.
- [ ] Fabric activity events appear hourly (Option A) or live (Option B).
- [ ] The Power BI report renders all five pages with real data.
- [ ] At least one Activator reflex has fired and notified a channel.

## Stretch goals

- **Cross-tenant audit.** Add a second tenant's activity feed via OneLake external
  sharing; show a unified dashboard.
- **Anomaly detection.** Add a KQL query using `series_decompose_anomalies` on
  PR throughput and feed it to the Activator.
- **Skill catalog usage telemetry.** Track which Skills your teams call and how
  often; surface as a fifth dashboard page.

## MCP tips

- The local MCP's `docs_best-practices` tool has a "real-time intelligence" topic
  that catalogs the patterns the Eventhouse + Eventstream skills follow.

## Skills tips

- The four authoring skills (Eventhouse, Eventstream, Power BI, Activator) run as
  separate processes. The agent sequences them; call them individually when debugging.
